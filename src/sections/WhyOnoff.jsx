                    Onoff builds flexible mobile experiences – and I love working on products that merge simplicity with power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve worked with component-based systems, reusable UI logic, and clean API integration — all of which are core to the frontend architecture Onoff uses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    React is my main stack, and I’m always looking for ways to write clearer, scalable code that supports collaboration and growth.
                </p>
